# NBA Shot Visualizer

## Rationale
I like basketball. So, I decided to try and visualize the areas on the court from which some of our favourite players were most dangerous (or not-so-dangerous). 

Please note: this is a project from a while ago, so the last season for which I have data is 2017-2018. Playoffs are also not included. That unfortunately does mean we can't visualize Playoff P's stats in the bubble. 

Sorry! 

## Features
See a player's shot performance for either individual games or for an entire season. If you select an individual game, you can filter shot selection by quarter. 

Want a little more detail? Then, check out the FGM/FGA, shot type breakdown and shot distance stats.
